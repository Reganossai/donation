        <h1>ANSWERS TO ALL YOUR INTERNATIONAL ADOPTION QUESTIONS</h1>

        <h6>Your Top Ten Adoption Questions Answered</h6>

        <h5>
          Just starting your adoption journey? We have the answers to the most
          common questions about adoption below.
        </h5>

        <h6>1. Why does adoption cost so much?</h6>

        <h5>
          Adoption costs a lot because it’s a legal process involving dual
          government cooperation. Home studies, agency fees, and the legal
          documents required to make a child eligible for adoption are also part
          of the cost. Travel is also another factor for international adoption.
          The adopting family is typically required to travel once or twice to
          the adoptive child’s birth country during the adoption process, which
          adds to the expense.
        </h5>

        <h6> 2. Why does it take so long to adopt internationally?</h6>

        <h5>
          It typically takes between six months and four years to complete an
          international adoption. This process takes time for several reasons:
        </h5>

        <h5>
          1. The documentation required for adoptive families and the home study
          process can be lengthy.
        </h5>

        <h5>
          2. The child is also required to go through a process to ensure
          eligibility, such as the termination of parental rights.
        </h5>

        <h5>
          3. The country’s government also has a role in approving a family to
          adopt and working with foreign governments can also add to the process
          as they typically are without as many resources.
        </h5>

        <h5>
          4. The length of the waiting family list, and the family’s place on
          this list can also make the process longer. However, this does not
          mean that there is not a need! The process is just slow-moving.
        </h5>

        <h5>
          5. After a family has been matched and approved, the U.S. embassy then
          needs to issue a visa to the adoptive child and recognize the
          adoption. All of these factors can take a while!
        </h5>

        <h6>3. Is there help with adoption costs?</h6>

        <h5>
          Yes! There are a lot of organizations that help with adoption and
          adoption related costs. There are so many wonderful resources for
          families adopting children with special needs or older children in
          particular.
        </h5>

        <h5>
          We also strongly encourage families to consider fundraising as a way
          to help with adoption costs. It’s a wonderful way to engage with your
          local community and allow others to contribute and be a part of your
          cause.
        </h5>

        <h6>4. Am I eligible to adopt?</h6>

        <h5>
          Each country has its own specific requirements regarding adoptive
          families. There are also requirements within the U.S. and AGCI. The
          three primary categories that affect eligibility are: medical,
          criminal, and financial backgrounds. Once a family decides on the
          program or country that they’d like to adopt from, we can see if it’ll
          be a good fit or suggest other programs that might fit their
          circumstances.
        </h5>

        <h6>5. What will the health of my adoptive child be like?</h6>

        <h5>
          The health of adoptive children ranges a lot. For example, our China
          adoption program is all special needs in some way. The special need
          could be very minor, or require surgery or ongoing care. We talk with
          each prospective adoptive family to see what they’re open to and go
          from there. The greatest need right now is for families willing to
          adopt a child with moderate special needs that might need an initial
          corrective surgery or ongoing care.
        </h5>

        <h6>6. Where’s the greatest need for adoptive families?</h6>

        <h5>
          We need families who are open to adopting children of all age ranges
          and mild to moderate special needs, as well as older children and
          sibling groups.
        </h5>

        <h6>7. Why can’t I adopt a healthy infant internationally?</h6>

        <h5>
          A lot of countries are beginning to understand the value of domestic
          adoption. This is a positive thing for children and families, but it’s
          also why toddlers are typically the youngest age available for
          international adoption.
        </h5>

        <h6>8. Why should I choose AGCI?</h6>

        <h5>
          We believe in offering families a really high level of support and
          provide information to prepare families for their adoption journey.
        </h5>

        <h5>
          From a broader standpoint, we are a truly child-centric organization.
          We have a holistic view of childcare that we bring into every country
          we work in. This means that when we train orphanage staff, we teach
          them how to care for children at the highest level. When we go into a
          country, we don’t just think about adoption; we think about what is
          the biggest need. For some communities, that’s not adoption, it’s
          family preservation or aging out support. We are sensitive to that and
          strive to do our best for children and their communities.
        </h5>

        <h6>9. What’s the Hague Convention?</h6>

        <h5>
          The Hague Convention is an international treaty that standardizes the
          adoption process. Many countries, including the United States, have
          signed this treaty. In addition to making the adoption process more
          transparent, it also involves the central authority more readily in
          the child placement process. It’s very costly for countries and
          agencies to become Hague compliant, which is why some countries choose
          not to comply. There are advantages and disadvantages to both Hague
          compliant and non-compliant countries. One advantage of non-compliant
          countries is that the adoption agency can be more involved in the
          placement of adoptive children. However, more countries are turning
          towards the Hague Convention as a way to minimize corruption and
          better standardize the adoption process.
        </h5>

        <h6>10. How do children transition into their adoptive families?</h6>

        <h5>
          Each child is unique and so is each transition! AGCI works hard to
          prepare families so the transition home can go as smoothly as
          possible. There are sometimes initial challenges when families first
          meet their adoptive child. Sometimes those challenges also manifest
          several months later when the child begins to test boundaries. All of
          these reactions are normal and part of developing a trusting
          relationship. AGCI supports families throughout this process and
          connects them with other adoptive families for questions and support.
          We’re always here for you! We also provide adoption education through
          the online learning platform, Families Are Forever. Ready to get

        <h6>
          Still have more questions? Here are a bonus 6 more of your top
          adoption questions answered!
        </h6>

        <h6>1. How can we ensure that the child is a legitimate orphan?</h6>

        <h5>
          There is a process to determine that a child is legally eligible for
          adoption. If the child’s birth country is a Hague country, the process
          must also be Hague compliant. Before issuing a visa, the US Embassy
          reviews the process to ensure that all procedures have been followed.
          While these measures to ensure legitimacy exist, it’s still important
          for families to choose an adoption agency that they fully trust. As
          adoption agencies are the ones pursuing relationships in-country, it’s
          particularly important that the family can trust that no documents
          have been falsified. It’s especially crucial to be sure that agencies
          do their due diligence in non-Hague countries where corruption can be
          more common.
        </h5>

        <h6>2. Is the adoption final?</h6>

        <h5>
          Yes. In most countries the legal process occurs in country and the
          adoption becomes final in country. If the country is a signatory to
          the Hague Convention, the adoption is permanent and irrevocable. If
          the country is not a signatory to the Hague Convention, re-adoption
          will ensure that the adoption is permanent and irrevocable under U.S.
          law. Before the child can be placed, they must first be legally
          relinquished by their birth parents or go through the abandonment
          process. To go through the abandonment process, the central authority
          needs to show that they have tried to contact all biological family
          members before the child can be placed for domestic or international
          adoption. If the family is responsive to contact, they must then
          decide that they are unable to care for the child or the government
          may reach this conclusion as well.
        </h5>

        <h6>3. Do we have to go through re-adoption?</h6>

        <h5>
          In most countries, if the child enters the U.S. on an IR-3 Visa, the
          child will enter the United States as a US citizen and re-adoption is
          not necessary for U.S. citizenship. However, if the child enters the
          U.S. on an IR-4 Visa, re-adoption is required to file for U.S.
          citizenship. Even if re-adoption is not necessary to obtain U.S.
          citizenship, AGCI strongly recommends that families pursue re-adoption
          for a number of other benefits. Re-adoption provides the adopted child
          with a birth certificate issued from their adoptive family’s home
          state, which can be very useful. Re-adoption protects the legal
          parent-child relationship under U.S. law regardless of changes to the
          adoption laws in the child’s birth country. Re-adoption also secures
          inheritance rights for an adopted child under states’ intestate laws.
          If the family plans on changing the adoptive child’s birth name, this
          can also be done during the re-adoption process. Once the adoptive
          child comes home, AGCI will provide information to the adoptive family
          on how to pursue re-adoption.
        </h5>

        <h6>4. What is the requirement for post-adoption reports?</h6>

        <h5>
          Post-adoption report requirements vary by program. There is often a
          series of reports required by a social worker. Some programs also
          require additional self-reports written by the adoptive family. It’s
          very important for families to comply with these reports for AGCI’s
          license and for country follow-ups. Additionally, these reports are an
          important support tool that provides families with practical benefits
          and an opportunity to ask questions and address any concerns.
        </h5>

        <h6>
          5. Can AGCI work with families outside of the states we are licensed
          with?
        </h6>

        <h5>
          Yes! While we are licensed to provide home study and post-adoption
          services in Oregon, Ohio, Kentucky, Michigan, Texas, Indiana, and
          Washington, families outside these states can also pursue adoption
          through AGCI. The majority of our adoptive families are actually
          outside of our licensed states! If a family would like to adopt
          through AGCI outside of the listed states, they will work with one of
          our cooperating agencies in their home state for home studies and
          post-adoption reports. AGCI will still remain the placing agency and
          primary point of contact.
        </h5>

        <h6>6. Why does AGCI like to place children following the natural birth order of the family?</h6>

        <h5>AGCI tries to maintain the natural birth order in adoptive families because we like to honor the place that the children hold within the family. For example, if an adoptive family has a 7-year-old child, we would try not to place a child over the age of 6 with that particular family. We’ve found that certain difficulties with transitions can be avoided when we follow the natural birth order. Different roles and behavior expectations are often associated with birth order. It’s also helpful to remember that many children placed within a family may not have lived in a family setting before. It can be helpful for adoptive children to learn how to behave in a family setting by learning from older siblings. Maintaining birth order is also important for children already in the family as the oldest child is often afforded certain privileges.</h5>

        <h5>However, when it comes to placing waiting children or older children, AGCI frequently considers exceptions to this. In this scenario, we would prepare the family on how these placements can be unique.</h5>
